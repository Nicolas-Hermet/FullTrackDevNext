## Honesty, Honesty... Remember?

Don't hide it-I know you tried working in your underwear last week. That's fine. I did too. But unlike you (maybe), I stopped almost immediately. Here's why.


Nine years ago I burned out. Nothing rare these days. One reason: zero separation between work and personal life. Same story many people face, except I decided to live right across from my office. One street to cross. I could see my desk from home and my living room from work. Handy, right?


It was the worst personal experience I've had. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Since then I've tried to live at least five minutes away from the office.


**So how do you avoid that when you work from home?**


That disaster taught me something: what matters is emotional separation. Build a dedicated mindset for work and another for personal life. Master that, and you can switch almost instantly.

## Build Your Remote-Work Mindset: Three Methods

### Method 1: Routine and Discipline


Start simple: set fixed hours, just like pre-lockdown.


Remember <Link href="https://www.fulltrack.dev/articles/le-teletravail-le-guide-complet-chapitre-ii" >my sample schedule</Link>? It wasn't random. Use it as a template and adjust every few days.


The key: make a mental effort to say "I'm at work" at the exact minute your day starts, and "I'm done" the minute it ends.


**Benefits**

- Easy to implement.
- Prevents overwork or underwork.
- Wear whatever you want-the clock is what matters. Throw on a shirt for video calls if needed. Or not. Your call.

**Drawbacks**

- Possible stress: "I'm late!"
- Less freedom for personal tasks. Laundry at lunch is great-until it's time to hang it up during work hours.
- If you're a night owl, strict hours feel unnatural.
- If your team peers over your shoulder virtually, they might expect instant replies because "you're at your desk."


### Method 2: Rituals (Advanced Routine)


Think of rituals as micro-switches guiding your brain from one mode to another. Combine them with idle time-the dead air we explored earlier-to boost productivity.


My rituals fall into three buckets: body, mind, transitions.


#### Body

- Morning exercises: stretches, a run, strength work. The activity changes, but there's always something. It tells my body we're about to work.
- Dedicated work clothes. During the shootout I even wore my racing suit to role-play being in the car. At home I stick to "office" gear during work hours and change afterward.
- Specific meals: breakfast before starting, protein at lunch, fruit or yogurt midafternoon.


#### Mind

- Twenty-minute meditation to focus-the same I do before a race.
- Use idle time to reset. The "Hospital" technique from Chapter II works wonders.
- Daily reviews in my notebook.


#### Transitions

- Set laptop and phone wallpaper to my car when I'm in "driver" mode. Silly? Maybe, but it cues my brain.
- Switch Slack status between "Available" and "Away." Simple, but effective.
- Playlists: upbeat music when I need energy, calm tracks when I edit video where audio doesn't matter. Either I'm locked in, or I'm drained-music points me toward the right tasks.


All of this together tells my brain, "We're working now." Or "We're done."


**Pros**

- Extremely effective once established.
- Helps avoid two classic pitfalls:
  - All-you-can-work days where you never stop.
  - Constantly sliding tasks to "later."

**Cons**

- Harder to set up. For months I had post-its everywhere. A coach helped me refine the system.
- Requires regular observation. Check that every element still serves you.
- More planning. It's worth it, but you have to commit.


In short: ideally make rituals your baseline. Just know they demand effort.


### Method 3: None of the Above


Yes, having *no* routine is a routine. It can be refreshing-break the rules, every day, several times a day. Novelty lifts your mood.


But that's remote-work level two. Don't try it unless you feel confident.


**"What about my coworkers?"**


Tell them. I have a teammate whose hours I never know. When we need to collaborate, I'm not sure if he's working or not. But it doesn't matter: he allows notifications, then ignores them when off. If he picks up, it's to say "Can we talk at XXh instead?" Works fine.


Remote work opens countless options. Experiment.


## Keep Work and Non-Work Separate


You can't afford to blur work and personal life forever. Not without consequences.


Overwork is one risk. When you log too many hours, productivity and effectiveness drop.


### Track Your Rhythm


Use a time tracker like <Link href="https://toggl.com/" >Toggl</Link> for a day or two.

<Image src="/images/teletravail-le-guide-complet-chapitre-iii/toggl-logo.jpg" alt="toggl-logo.jpg" width="1500" height="929" caption="Toggl shows where your time really goes."/>

It confirms whether you're working enough-or too much-and flags tasks that drag on at the expense of others.


Managers: properly configured, it beats a spreadsheet for spotting bottlenecks.


### Separate Devices


If you use the same computer for work and Netflix, everything blurs. Keep two user accounts-or two computers if possible. Install work tools on one, personal apps on the other.


Switching accounts can become part of your ritual.


### Honesty, Always


If people assume you're working, then work. If you're not, tell them and catch up later.


One coworker regularly emailed: "I need to step away for the next two to three hours. Back later." No justification. Everyone knew he was offline. As long as the job gets done, no one minds.


**"If I do that, I'll get in trouble."**


If that's your reality, I hear you. Unfortunately it's a trust issue. I'll tackle it in a future article. For now, talk with your manager, reassure them, share these pieces if it helps.


## That's It for Today


I hope this helps. Let me know on <Link href="https://twitter.com/HermetNicolas" >Twitter</Link> or <Link href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-hermet/" >LinkedIn</Link>. Share your setup and role so others can learn-and because I'm curious.


I meant to dive into team organization, hallway chats, coffee breaks... and got carried away.


Unless you have burning questions, that's the next chapter.


See you soon. :)
