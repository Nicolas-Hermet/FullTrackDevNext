## Break Time!


The mythical coffee machine I've been referencing for half a dozen articles? Here it is.


You've seen how awkward breaks feel when working remotely. Either you skip them entirely or you take too many.


That quick brain reset you used to get in front of the machine-the two-minute detour-is missing.


Let's fix it.


## Pick the Right Tool


Any video app will do. I like <Link href="https://jitsi.org/" >Jitsi</Link>.


Why? It's free, open source, and ridiculously easy to use. The project is maintained by passionate developers, not a revenue machine.


But use whatever works for you.


### "Video calls are a pain, and we already spend all day in them..."


True, you shouldn't have that many meetings in the first place-but that's a topic for another chapter.


Right now, during confinement, a casual hangout still needs video. There's no alternative if you want to see each other.


As for the hassle-installing apps, aligning schedules, starting on time, admitting you have nothing crucial to say, making sure someone stays connected so the call doesn't end for everyone... yes, that sounds painful.


Because you lost the casual element: the "Coffee break?" whispered by Regis as he passes your desk.


### The Video Room That Never Ends


Think about it: your break room never closed.


You can mimic that by keeping a video room open permanently. No, not like a reality show, don't worry.


Set up a room that no one "owns" and everyone can join whenever they want. Drop in for a break, leave when you're done. Just like the office kitchen where the coffee machine now gathers dust.


> <Link href="https://meet.jit.si/" >meet.jit.si</Link>


Click the link above.


You'll see a simple screen:
<Image src="/images/teletravail-le-guide-complet-bonus-machine-a-cafe/jitsi1.jpg" alt="jitsi1.jpg" width="772" height="330" caption="Your custom room name becomes the link."/>

Type a short phrase (no spaces) to customize the URL, then hit **Go**. In the example I used "LaMachineACafeDeLaCOGIP."


The text you enter becomes the link you share:

<Image src="/images/teletravail-le-guide-complet-bonus-machine-a-cafe/jitsi2.png" alt="jitsi2.png" width="376" height="54" caption="Share the personalized link with your coworkers."/>

**meet.jit.si/YourAwesomeRoomName**


This step is optional-you can just click **Go** and use the random link provided.



## Important Notes


### The Main Risk

- It's not private. If someone tries enough combinations starting with <Link href="http://meet.jit.si/" >http://meet.jit.si/</Link>, they can land in your room. It's easy for anyone with basic tech skills. Treat it like the coffee machine at the cafe down the street: no confidential company talk. You're here to relax anyway.
- Make the room name long enough-reduces the odds of random visitors. The auto-generated string is already pretty safe.


### The Perks

- You never "schedule" this video call. The URL works permanently.
- Need a break? Click the link (bookmark it!). Sometimes no one is there; sometimes it's packed-just like the office coffee corner.
- There's a <Link href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jitsi.meet&gl=FR" >mobile app</Link>. Use it! Get off your desk chair, walk to the couch, stand by the window, step into your garden if you have one. Give your mind a change of scenery.


## Keep It Separate from "Real" Meetings


If you need a serious meeting with the same coworkers, use a different link. Otherwise you'll block those who want a casual break. And remember: this URL is not private.


Enjoy the pause! (Grab a seat, kick back, sip that coffee.)
